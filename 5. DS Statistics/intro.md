# Introduction to Statistics

Statistics is the science of analyzing data.

When we have created a model for prediction, we must assess the prediction's reliability.

After all, what is a prediction worth, if we cannot rely on it?

# Descriptive Statistics

We will first cover some basic descriptive statistics.

Descriptive statistics summarizes important features of a data set such as:

Count
Sum
Standard Deviation
Percentile
Average
Etc..
It is a good starting point to become familiar with the data.

We can use the describe() function in Python to summarize the data:

Example

<div class="termy">

```console
$ print (full_health_data.describe())

```

</div>
